#SuperBowl? Sure. #PuppyBowl? It's fine. But #OtterBowl? That's something we can get behind! Here Yaku poses with the "ball," which is actually a little frozen clam formula.
Who's ready for some football?! Our #SeaOtters received some special enrichment today in anticipation of the big game. Here Yaku eyes an edible football while rescue Kiana considers an "interception."
New digs for the gators! We recently moved our American alligators to a larger habitat in our Islands and Lakes gallery, where they have plenty of room to swim around and bask on the rocks.
At #SheddTeenWorkStudy, not only do teens get to interpret about different animals at Shedd, they conduct their own ethogram projects by researching, observing, and collecting data about the behaviors of an animal they're curious about at the aquarium.
